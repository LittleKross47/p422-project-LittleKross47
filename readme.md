# Home note and documentation

## Abstract

This project should allow users to utilize the following functionality:

- Create objects with custom fields
- Add notes or additional fields to objects
- Create heirarchy between objects
- View a graphical representation of the heirarchy
- Pull reports on object statuses

## Implementation details

This project will utilize:

- An angular front end
- Bootstrap for front end styling
- A node backend
- A mongoDB database
- Mongoose for interfacing with the database
- A versioned api, beginning at version 0.1.0

## Mission

The goal of this project is to create a simple yet effective way of representing any object-set and relations. This will provide easily accessible information about systems as well as vusualizing the relationships that arise. This can be used for home upkeep or for noting potential structuring of a project.

## Potential growth

There is potential for this to grow in several areas:

- Improving this to be a full fledged relationship visualizer
- Improving the database to be encrypted
- Improving the api to be transfer information more efficient (i.e. utilizing a graphql api)
- Improving by adding a signin system
- Improving by also adding a note syncing system for local notes
